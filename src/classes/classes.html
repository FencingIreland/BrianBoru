            Fencing is an exciting and dynamic sport for all ages. If you are not sure if you
            will be into fencing or you want to try first, contact us and we can organise for you to come
            down to the club on one of our evenings try fencing for free.

        <h5>Beginners course</h5>
        <p> We regularly run a 8 week Beginner course.</p>
        <p>
            Our beginners classes cover the main aspects of fencing and are ideal for people with no previous experiance.
            We take you through the rules, techniques and terminology of the sport of fencing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The class covers conditioning, footwork, blade drills, fencing with electric scorning equipment and individual instruction.

            We provide all equipment at the club so all you need to bring to start is a tracksuit,
            t-shirt, trainers and some water.

        <h5>Fenced Before</h5>
        <p>If you have fenced a before or several years ago and want to pick it back up,
           we'd suggest booking an assesment with our coach Radu so he can determine what
           training options will suit you best.
